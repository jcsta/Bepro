A brief description of your project.
An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Bepro.

The market is on the rise and along with it, many people are taking advantage of selling easily without work. People are entering the crypto market with false promises and illusions and they suffer when they lose money, either because of lack of education, too much greed, or being deceived by scams. We want to be able to deliver content that shows them how to protect themselves and how to analyze good projects. We believe that nft games are THE GATEWAY for millions of people in the crypto world and we want to bring the knowledge they need to get in and stay, keep investing and earning money to help their families. 
Videos of the main games of the moment will be created, also metaverse projects, mainly based on BePro (like RealFevr, Punk Skin, Royale, Exeedme, etc). One free access per month will be given to the new followers that we get through this generation of content, to our paid platform, so that we have course feedback and generation of content with social proof to boost our growth. The purpose of the project is to create a COMMUNITY and EDUCATE new people who are coming to the crypto world, bring news from the world of nft games, especially Bepro projects, and show our new METHODOLOGY that helps to analyze projects, preventing them from falling into scams and helping them to maximize their gains in good projects. This methodology consists of:

Analyzing projects and their fundamentals

The team behind the game

Tokenomics

Other variables We truly believe that nft games are the gateway for thousands of people to the crypto world and we want to show the best way for these new entrants. Let's start with this 6 month educational project to show our work to the BePro team, initially focusing on Brazil and then, all Latin America. This will be the first step of a great project for 2022. The purpose of using paid ads is to be able to access people who are already interested in the crypto world and new people who have never heard about nft games and be able to bring them to our social media to show our work. In this way, we maximize the results.

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project. In 2018 I created a digital marketing agency to sell courses in Brazil focusing on content marketing, that is, delivering educational value to the customer before making a sale, making the sales process much lighter. We invested a lot in facebook and google ads during this period and we have the knowledge to reach the right customers through these platforms. In 2021 I created the first nft games Portal in Brazil, a paid platform that teaches about nft games and how to play the main games, with teachers with experience and high technical capacity.

### Project Details

We want to educate people with high quality content and show our nft game analysis methodology that brings security and knowledge to those who use it. Through free content on our instagram and youtube channel, we will educate people how to start in nft games avoiding scams and illusions:

Create a community
Educate new people who are coming to the crypto world
Bring news from the world of nft games
Show our methodology to analyze projects. We truly believe that nft games are the GATEWAY to the crypto world for thousands of people and we want to show the best path for these new entrants. This helps the entire blockchain ecosystem, which is just in its infancy. Our work is just beginning.

We want to reach the general public. New people who are hearing now about bitcoin, blockchain, nfts and metaverse. We want to bring quality content so they don't fall into traps like many others have.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

Education. As we believe that many people will enter the blockchain universe through games, we want to educate them in the best way

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem?

We didn't find any similar project on any network. We see many content creators bringing content to gain views, but few are concerned with delivering quality content and educating.
