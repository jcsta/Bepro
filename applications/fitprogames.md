We believe that nft games are THE GATEWAY for millions of people in the crypto world and we want to bring the knowledge they need to get in and stay, keep investing right and earning money to help their families.

A brief description of your project.
An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Bepro.

The market is on the rise and along with it, many people are taking advantage of selling easily without work. People are entering the crypto market with false promises and illusions and they suffer when they lose money, either because of lack of education, too much greed, or being deceived by scams. We want to be able to deliver content that shows them how to protect themselves and how to analyze good projects. We believe that nft games are THE GATEWAY for millions of people in the crypto world and we want to bring the knowledge they need to get in and stay, keep investing and earning money to help their families. 
Videos of the main games of the moment will be created, also metaverse projects, mainly based on BePro (like RealFevr, Punk Skin, Royale, Exeedme, etc). One free access per month will be given to the new followers that we get through this generation of content, to our paid platform, so that we have course feedback and generation of content with social proof to boost our growth. The purpose of the project is to create a COMMUNITY and EDUCATE new people who are coming to the crypto world, bring news from the world of nft games, especially Bepro projects, and show our new METHODOLOGY that helps to analyze projects, preventing them from falling into scams and helping them to maximize their gains in good projects. This methodology consists of:

Analyzing projects and their fundamentals

The team behind the game

Tokenomics

Other variables We truly believe that nft games are the gateway for thousands of people to the crypto world and we want to show the best way for these new entrants. Let's start with this 6 month educational project to show our work to the BePro team, initially focusing on Brazil and then, all Latin America. This will be the first step of a great project for 2022. The purpose of using paid ads is to be able to access people who are already interested in the crypto world and new people who have never heard about nft games and be able to bring them to our social media to show our work. In this way, we maximize the results.

An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project. In 2018 I created a digital marketing agency to sell courses in Brazil focusing on content marketing, that is, delivering educational value to the customer before making a sale, making the sales process much lighter. We invested a lot in facebook and google ads during this period and we have the knowledge to reach the right customers through these platforms. In 2021 I created the first nft games Portal in Brazil, a paid platform that teaches about nft games and how to play the main games, with teachers with experience and high technical capacity.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

We want to educate people with high quality content and show our nft game analysis methodology that brings security and knowledge to those who use it. Through free content on our instagram and youtube channel, we will educate people how to start in nft games avoiding scams and illusions:

Create a community
Educate new people who are coming to the crypto world
Bring news from the world of nft games
Show our methodology to analyze projects. We truly believe that nft games are the GATEWAY to the crypto world for thousands of people and we want to show the best path for these new entrants. This helps the entire blockchain ecosystem, which is just in its infancy. Our work is just beginning.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Blockchain landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The market is on the rise and along with it, many people are taking advantage of selling easily without work. People are entering the crypto market with false promises and illusions and they suffer when they lose money, either because of lack of education, too much greed, or being deceived by scams. We want to be able to deliver content that teaches them how to protect themselves and how to analyze good projects. We believe that nft games are THE GATEWAY for millions of people in the crypto world and we want to bring the knowledge they need to get in and stay, keep investing and earning money to help their families. Videos of the main games of the moment will be created and a % of the videos will be from game projects and metaverse based on the BePro. One free access per month will be given to the new followers that we get through this generation of content, to our paid platform, so that we have course feedback and generation of content with social proof to boost our growth.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

We want to reach the general public. New people who are hearing now about bitcoin, blockchain, nfts and metaverse. We want to bring quality content so they don't fall into traps like many others have.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

Education. As we believe that many people will enter the blockchain universe through games, we want to educate them in the best way


* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the BEPRO Network ecosystem?
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

We didn't find any similar project on any network. We see many content creators bringing content to gain views, but few are concerned with delivering quality content and educating.

For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful.

In 2018 I created a digital marketing agency to sell courses in Brazil focusing on content marketing, that is, delivering educational value to the customer before making a sale, making the sales process much lighter. We invested a lot in facebook and google ads during this period and we have the knowledge to reach the right customers through these platforms.

Videos will be posted on the channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0KxouO07burpQGsYt5mX1w

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to BEPRO Network. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

For this phase of the project, I want to be able to show the quality of my work to later create an even bigger project. It will be 6 months of project: 

Month 1: 
Marketing - Paid Ads: 40/day = $ 1200 
Content generation, posts, news and articles: $ 2000

2 videos per week with the new teaching methodology with more than 30 minutes on youtube
5 posts per week with news from nft games and metaverse on instagram
1 article per week for the blog

Month 2: 
Marketing - Paid Ads: 40/day = $ 1200 
Content generation, posts, news and articles: $ 2000

2 videos per week with the new teaching methodology with more than 30 minutes on youtube
5 posts per week with news from nft games and metaverse on instagram
1 article per week for the blog

Month 3, 4, 5 and 6: 
Marketing - Paid Ads: 40/day = $ 1200 
Content generation, posts, news and articles: $ 2000

2 videos per week with the new teaching methodology with more than 30 minutes on youtube
5 posts per week with news from nft games and metaverse on instagram
1 article per week for the blog 

Potential reach: 100.000 people/month reached. 2% visits (conservative). We do not estimate the number of new followers because there are no metrics for this, but with the number of visits, we will impact a lot of people with quality content. Videos of the main games of the moment will be created and a % of the videos will be from game projects, NFT and metaverse based on the BePro.

In summary: 
Marketing: $7200 
Content generation: $12000 
For 6 months

## Future Plans

Please include here

* how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term, and
* the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

Let's start with this 6 month educational project to show our work to the BePro Protocol team, initially focusing on Brazil and then, all Latin America. This will be the first step of a great project for 2022.

After the 6 months successfully concluded, we will move on to the Second Phase, which will be to create a team with social media, writer, Community manager and content generators for Brazil (Portuguese language) and Latin America (Spanish language), maintaining the same content delivery strategy about nft games and metaverse as a gateway to the crypto universe. There are more than 600 million people and we want to create value and quality of content for Latin Americans.
